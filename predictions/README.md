# predictions/

`lab run` writes into the committed `results/` only after the run's prediction is committed here. One file per run name.

Required: two non-empty level-2 sections.

```markdown
# <run name>

## Prediction
What the number will do, against which baseline, on which metric. Say "unsure" if you are.

## Mechanism
Why. The argument that makes the prediction, written before the result exists.
```

The gate checks that the file is tracked by git and has no uncommitted edits, then records the commit in the results file.
